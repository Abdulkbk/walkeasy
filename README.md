# Project Name: WalkEasy

## Introduction
Welcome to the **WalkEasy** repository! This mobile application is built using [Flutter], a cross-platform framework for building beautiful, fast, and reliable mobile applications.

The application makes use of [Firebase] and [Firestore] as the backend platform and database, respectively. Firebase provides a range of powerful tools and services for building mobile and web applications, including authentication, storage, and real-time database. Firestore is a NoSQL document-oriented database that allows for easy storage and retrieval of data.

I strive to follow best practices in software development, including writing clean and maintainable code, conducting thorough testing, and using version control (Git).
